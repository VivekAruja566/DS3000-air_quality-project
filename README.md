# DS3000 Air Quality ML Project

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **EPA Air Quality System (AQS) Annual Summary**.

Because the file size exceeds GitHub’s upload limit, you can download it directly from the official EPA website:

**Download Link:**  
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html

We used the file:  
**annual_conc_by_monitor_2024.zip**  
(then extract to get `annual_conc_by_monitor_2024.csv`)

Place the CSV file in the project root directory before running `air_quality_project.py`.
