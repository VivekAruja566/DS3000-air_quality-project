# DS3000 Air Quality ML Project

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **EPA Air Quality System (AQS) Annual Summary**.

Because the file size exceeds GitHub’s upload limit, the file has been uploaded as a zip file. For it to work with the project convert the zip file into a csv file:

We used the file:  
**annual_conc_by_monitor_2024.zip**  
(then extract to get `annual_conc_by_monitor_2024.csv`)

Place the CSV file in the project root directory before running `air_quality_project.py`.
